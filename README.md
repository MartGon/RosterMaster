# RosterMaster
## Description

RosterMaster is a tool that officers from World of Warcraft guilds can use to organize rosters for 10 man raids. By aggregating different data sources, this tool can check the validity of rosters and calculate a score based on several factors, such as buff/debuff coverage, loot distribution, melee/caster balance, presence of key roles, etc. It can also be used to review signups, to ensure that everyone has marked their attendance to raids. Finally, RosterMaster can also generate valid rosters, by exploring a given amount of random generated rosters and selecting the top five with the highest score obtained.
